## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure

```
ScheduleView (main orchestrator - full-screen responsive)
├── NavigationBar (sticky top bar with branding)
├── Sidebar (collapsible with mobile drawer)
│   ├── DoctorSelector (doctor dropdown)
│   ├── DatePicker (date selection)
│   └── Legend (appointment type colors)
├── ComparisonView (NEW - multi-doctor comparison)
│   ├── Statistics Cards (doctor metrics)
│   └── Comparison Grid (side-by-side schedules)
├── DayView (day timeline calendar)
│   └── AppointmentCard (reusable)
└── WeekView (week grid calendar)
    └── AppointmentCard (reused)
```

#### Why this structure?

- **Separation of Concerns** - Each component has single responsibility
- **Reusability** - AppointmentCard shared across all views
- **Composability** - Loose coupling between components
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new views
- **Maintainability** - Changes isolated to specific components

---

### State Management

**Approach:** ✅ Custom hooks (headless pattern) + useState

#### Hooks Created:

```typescript
useAppointments(doctorId, date)       // Day appointments
useWeekAppointments(doctorId, week)   // Week appointments  
useAllAppointments(date)              // All doctors (comparison)
useDoctors()                          // Doctor management
useCalendarView()                     // View state
```

#### Why this approach?

- **Headless Pattern:** Complete logic/UI separation
- **Testability:** Independent hook testing
- **Reusability:** Shared across components
- **Performance:** Built-in memoization
- **Simplicity:** No external dependencies
- **Clean Components:** Pure presentation

---

### Service Layer

**Structure:** Class-based singleton

```typescript
class AppointmentService {
  getAllDoctors(): Doctor[]
  getDoctorById(id): Doctor | undefined
  getAppointmentsByDoctor(id): Appointment[]
  getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDate(id, date): Appointment[]
  getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDateRange(id, start, end): Appointment[]
  getFilteredAppointments(filters): Appointment[]
}
```

#### Benefits:

- **Encapsulation:** Grouped operations
- **Single Responsibility:** Data access only
- **Easy Migration:** Swap mock → API
- **Testability:** Simple mocking
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support

---

/* Thin, minimal scrollbars */
::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 6px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.3);
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

**Classes Added:**

- `scrollbar-hide` - Hidden scrollbars
- `calendar-scroll` - Branded scrollbars

---

### Comparison View (NEW)

#### Features:

- Statistics cards with metrics per doctor
- Side-by-side schedule grid
- Color-coded appointment counts
- Appointment type breakdown
- Total hours calculation
- Empty state handling

#### Design Rationale:

- Quick visual comparison
- Easy workload assessment
- Identify scheduling gaps
- Professional dashboard feel

---

### Calendar Rendering

#### Time Slots:

- **Day:** 30-min intervals (detailed view)
- **Week:** 1-hour intervals (overview)
- **Comparison:** 1-hour intervals (clarity)

#### Appointment Display:

- Color-coded borders
- Patient name prominent
- Time and duration shown
- Type badge included
- Hover effects for feedback
- Stacked for overlaps

#### Responsive Breakpoints:

```css
Mobile:  < 768px  → Hamburger menu, stacked layout
Tablet:  768-1024px → Collapsible sidebar
Desktop: > 1024px  → Fixed sidebar, full layout
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Code Quality

- ✅ `npm run lint` - No errors
- ✅ `npm run type-check` - No TypeScript errors
- ✅ `npm run build` - Builds successfully
- ✅ Manual testing - All features work

### Testing Performed

## 🤔 Assumptions Made

1. **Time Zones:** All times in local timezone
2. **Working Hours:** Appointments within doctor hours
3. **Week Start:** Monday (hospital standard)
4. **Data:** Current week (mock data limitation)
5. **Access:** Internal hospital staff (no auth needed)
6. **Scrolling:** Users comfortable with scroll
7. **Screen Size:** Minimum 320px width

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

## 🎓 Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Service Layer Pattern

```typescript
// Encapsulates data access logic
class AppointmentService {
  private static instance: AppointmentService;
  
  getAllDoctors(): Doctor[] { }
  getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDate(id: string, date: Date): Appointment[] { }
  // ... more methods
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for data
- Easy to swap implementations
- Testable in isolation

---

### 2. Headless Component Pattern

```typescript
// Hook contains all business logic
function useAppointments(doctorId: string, date: Date) {
  const [appointments, setAppointments] = useState<Appointment[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Logic here
  }, [doctorId, date]);
  
  return { appointments, loading, error };
}

// Component is pure presentation
function DayView() {
  const { appointments, loading } = useAppointments(doctorId, date);
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  return <AppointmentList appointments={appointments} />;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Logic reusable across components
- Easy to test independently
- Clean component code

---

### 3. Component Composition

```typescript
// Small, focused components
<ScheduleView>
  <Sidebar>
    <DoctorSelector />
    <DatePicker />
    <Legend />
  </Sidebar>
  
  <MainContent>
    {view === 'day' && <DayView />}
    {view === 'week' && <WeekView />}
    {view === 'comparison' && <ComparisonView />}
  </MainContent>
</ScheduleView>
```

**Benefits:**
- Reusable components
- Easy to maintain
- Testable units

---

### 4. Domain Models (Optional)

```typescript
// Business logic encapsulated in domain objects
class TimeSlot {
  constructor(public start: Date, public end: Date) {}
  
  overlaps(other: TimeSlot): boolean {
    return this.start < other.end && this.end > other.start;
  }
  
  contains(date: Date): boolean {
    return date >= this.start && date < this.end;
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Business rules in one place
- Type-safe operations
- Reusable across application

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Time Slot Generation

```typescript
// Generates time slots for calendar
function generateTimeSlots(
  startHour: number,
  endHour: number,
  intervalMinutes: number,
  date: Date
): TimeSlot[] {
  const slots: TimeSlot[] = [];
  
  for (let hour = startHour; hour < endHour; hour++) {
    for (let minute = 0; minute < 60; minute += intervalMinutes) {
      const start = new Date(date);
      start.setHours(hour, minute, 0, 0);
      
      const end = new Date(start);
      end.setMinutes(end.getMinutes() + intervalMinutes);
      
      slots.push(new TimeSlot(start, end));
    }
  }
  
  return slots;
}
```

---

### Appointment Filtering

```typescript
// Efficient appointment filtering by time range
getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDateRange(
  doctorId: string,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date
): Appointment[] {
  return this.appointments.filter(apt => {
    if (apt.doctorId !== doctorId) return false;
    
    const aptStart = new Date(apt.startTime);
    return aptStart >= startDate && aptStart < endDate;
  });
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Initial deployment
vercel

# Production deployment
vercel --prod

```

### Build Configuration

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

---

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Implemented

1. **useMemo for time slots**
```typescript
const timeSlots = useMemo(() => 
  generateTimeSlots(startHour, endHour, interval, selectedDate),
  [selectedDate]
);
```

2. **useCallback for handlers**
```typescript
const handleDoctorChange = useCallback((doctorId: string) => {
  setSelectedDoctor(doctorId);
}, []);
```

3. **Efficient filtering**
```typescript
// Filter in service layer, not component
const appointments = appointmentService
  .getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDate(doctorId, date);
```

4. **Proper dependencies**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchAppointments();
}, [doctorId, date]); // Only re-run when these change
```
